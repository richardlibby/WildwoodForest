# Initial thoughts on the project

# This is a project to create a Raspberry PI that has features from the following wishlist: (roughly in priority order)
# -Pi-hole (DNS and ad blocker) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inmBhY3HgQE or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytlAN18X5d0
# -Wireless Print Server https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi-print-server
# -Network Monitoring Tool https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-raspberry-pi-network-monitoring-tool/
# -Dynaframe (Media frame) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f92ypMnDEs
# -NAS File Server https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/raspberry-pi-nas/
# -Weather Station (not PI but may be helpful for my particular weather station) http://web-tech.ga-usa.com/2011/11/linux-fedora-pywws-and-ws-1090-ambient-weather-station/index.html
# -Home Automation System https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-finds/2018/07/12/everything-you-need-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-home-automation/#6e8ad65c4cdb
# -Digital dashboard (Calendar for wall, or maybe dynamic signage) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR_yko0gr-Y
# -Pentester/network sniffer kit (Pineapple or Kali-Linux variant)
# -VPN server https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/raspberry-pi-vpn/
# -Home router with logging by user (sort of web proxy but for more than just port 80)
# -Time Lapse Camera https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-zero-time-lapse-cam
